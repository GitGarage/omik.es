1. Copy my script.txt file a http://omik.es/assets/script.txt

2. Open you browser terminal; The terminal is modtly used for debugging code, 
but is relatively simple to use (copy the text file from step 1, paste next to the blue arrow in console, and hit enter.)

Opening console by Web Browser type.

Opera -  CTRL + SHIFT + I

Firefox - CTRL + SHIFT + K to open the Web console (COMMAND + SHIFT + K on Macs).

Chrome -  CTRL + SHIFT + J

LOOK FOR BLUE rightward pointing arrow within the terminal! 
You have have to scroll down to find it sometimes. 
After clicking just to the right of this arrow, paste the script above and hit enter.

Final Step: confirm success of the script. 
In the top right corner of the new beta Tiny Chat,
 the dumb blue and white advertising buttons are now replaced with two new options, 
auto-scroll and stop autoscroll.

I was inspired to write this due to the constant annoyance of having to scroll 
to the bottom of the chat each time I looked at another browser window.

Unfortunately this prevented users to EVER to be able to scroll up, so I added a second button
which pauses the functionality of the autoscroll until it is re-enabled.

One problem with the program is that the script has to be reentered every time you refresh, 
but I have a plan for that on the works.

Special Thanks to all those to help my test this little side hobby of mine.

Please enjoy
